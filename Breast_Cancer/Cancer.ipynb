    "# Breast Cancer Data Prediction Using Daimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be working with a dataset from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. It has nine attribute columns to describe various aspects of cells and one classification column that classifies each cell as benign or malignant cancer. More information about the data can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two goals: one is to build a model predicting whether a cell is benign or malignant on future cell data and the other is to use attribute rank to learn about which attributes of the cell are most important for predicting cancer in cells. Daimensions' attribute rank option is useful for a lot of biomedical data like cancer cells because most of the time we are not only looking to predict which cells are cancerous but also what caused the cancer. Attribute rank helps us learn about this aspect of the data by telling us which attributes most closely correlate with a cell's classification. This greatly contributes to our understanding of the data and helps guide us toward probable cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a look at our training data and the attributes we're using. For the target column, 2 is benign and 4 is malignant."

However, what might be of greater interest is looking at the output from building our predictor, specifically the attributes that Daimensions decided to use. Under the section of output called \"Attribute Rank,\" Daimensions has listed the attributes used: Uniformity_of_Cell_Size, Bare_Nuclei, Clump_Thickness, Marginal_Adhesion, Mitoses, and Uniformity_of_Cell_Shape. This information about what attributes were the best predictors of malignant cancer cells is valuable to scientists looking for the causes of this cancer."
