    "# Titanic Using Daimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses data from the Titanic competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle's description of the competition:\n",
    "\"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered 'unsinkable' RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there werenâ€™t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",
    "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: 'what sorts of people were more likely to survive?' using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Make a predictor of survival from Titanic training data. We'll do this by using Daimensions to measure, build, and validate a predictor."
