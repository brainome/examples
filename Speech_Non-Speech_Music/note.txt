The requirement of ffmpeg is because Librosa will fail to load .mp3 files (and certain other audio formats) without it. Additionally, 
when running `python make_data.py` you may add `-W ignore` (i.e. `python -W ignore make_data.py`) in order to supress warnings. This 
will clean up the output as Librosa issues a warning whenever it resorts to fmmpeg for loading an audio file.
