    "# Titanic Using Daimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses data from the Titanic competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle's description of the competition:\n",
    "\"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered 'unsinkable' RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",
    "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: 'what sorts of people were more likely to survive?' using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Make a predictor of survival from Titanic training data. We'll do this by using Daimensions to measure, build, and validate a predictor."

    "## 1. Get Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring our data before building a predictor is important in order to avoid mistakes and optimize our model. If we don't measure our data, we have no way of knowing whether the predictor we build will actually do what we want it to do when it sees new data that it wasn’t trained on. We'll probably build a model that is much larger than it needs to be, meaning our training and run times will probably be much longer than they need to be. We could end up in a situation where we just don’t know whether we have the right amount or right type of training data, even after extensive training and testing. Because of these reasons, it's best to measure our data beforehand. Not to mention, Daimensions will tell us about learnability, the generalization ratio, noise resilience, and all the standard accuracy and confusion figures. \n",

    "Our model did pretty well, but let's see if we can improve it. A column that contains a unique value in each row (for example a database key) will never contribute to generalization, so we shouldn't include database keys or other unique ID columns. We can remove these columns by using '-ignorecolumns'. We'll try ignoring columns: PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked, because they're all unique ID columns. We could also use '-rank' to rank columns by significance and only process contributing attributes.\n",

    "There may be situations where domain knowledge suggests a better choice of features than -rank. If we know the data generative process, we can do better with -ignorecolumns than with -rank. Rank is also optimizing for quick clustering/decision tree. For neural networks, we may still wish to reduce input features, which can be done with pca, but at the cost of interpretability. Some applications may require the original features are used in which case pca isn't viable. Ignorecolumns can reduce features while maintaining interpretability and work better for neural networks than -rank may, but the burden of choosing the right columns to keep is now on us."
